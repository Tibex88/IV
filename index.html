                                <h2>Just a hobby</h2>
                                <p>Fikir was always into crafting,
                                    making, and fixing different
                                    items. The
                                    journey began while looking for
                                    a present for a neighborhood
                                    friend who
                                    had recently become a
                                    mother.&nbsp;After considering
                                    all the basic
                                    options, she decided to crochet
                                    a shoe for the newborn. She
                                    succeeded in
                                    delighting her neighbor with her
                                    present. News traveled fast
                                    through the
                                    community, and people began
                                    asking her to make the shoe for
                                    them. In her
                                    second year, 2016, she began
                                    making a name for her craft. She
                                    pursued it
                                    further when she saw that she
                                    was actually making money out of
                                    her
                                    hobby.</p>
                                <p><br></p>
                                <p>The young designer picked up her
                                    crocheting skills from her mom
                                    and
                                    developed them through formal
                                    education. She studied
                                    Industrial design
                                    at Addis Ababa University, which
                                    she says helped sharpen her
                                    skills. She
                                    explained that the excitement of
                                    her job keeps her going. Had it
                                    been
                                    only for making a living, it
                                    would have been tenuous.</p>

                                <p>When Fikir graduated, she had
                                    made up her mind to be
                                    self-employed.
                                    Together with a friend, they
                                    went around doing wall painting
                                    for coffee
                                    shops and other places. They
                                    later joined to start making the
                                    crocheted
                                    shoe. After a while, Fikir took
                                    over the project and built it
                                    into the

                                    labored to make her workshop a
                                    place
                                    where Ethiopian traditional
